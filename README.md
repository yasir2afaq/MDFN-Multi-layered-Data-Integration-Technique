# Water-Extraction-MDFN-Multi-scaled-Deep-Neural-Netwrk

Using publicly available satellite imagery data we train a convolutional neural net to predict water occurrences in satellite images. MDFN achieved outmost performance for the prediction of water bodies from sentinel-2 satellite imagery datat.
